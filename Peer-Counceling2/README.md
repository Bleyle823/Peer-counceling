## Description
Peer-Counceling works by connecting users with therapists via video chat, phone, or messaging. This allows users to have access to therapy services from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, Peer-Counceling also provides users with digital journals, goal trackers, worksheets, and wellness tools to help them on their mental health journey.   The blockchain can be used to better these systems by providing a secure and reliable platform for users to access therapy services and store data. The blockchain can be used to ensure that payments are securely processed and that content creators are fairly compensated. Furthermore, the blockchain can be used to provide features such as automatic video transcoding, scalability, and dynamic pricing, ensuring that the user experience is seamless and secure.
